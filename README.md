# My Data Structures Files
In this repository I am displaying labs, projects, and exams for the Data Structures class I took at *UC Merced in 2016*.
## Course Description:
Focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of fundamental data structures, design patterns, and algorithms used throughout computer science, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, recursion, and methods for searching and sorting. 
## Resources:
Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, 2nd Edition written by by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, David M. Mount
